Here is a simple, clean, intuitive explanation of those statements — no math, no jargon, just the logic behind ROC curves, false positives, and choosing the right cut-off.

✅ First: What does the ROC curve actually show?

The ROC curve is a tool that helps you decide where to set the probability cut-off for predicting fraud.

Your model outputs a probability like:
User A → 0.92 → likely fraud
User B → 0.10 → probably safe
User C → 0.48 → unclear

You must choose a threshold (also called cut-off):
If probability ≥ threshold → classify as FRAUD
If probability < threshold → classify as NOT FRAUD

The ROC curve tells you what happens when you move that threshold up or down

🚦 Understanding threshold behavior

✔ If you increase the threshold, you become stricter.
You say:
“I will only call it fraud if I’m VERY sure.”
Effects:
✔ False positives go down (few innocent users are flagged)
✘ True positives go down (more real frauds slip through)

✔ If you decrease the threshold, you become more sensitive.
You say:
“I’d rather catch every possible fraud, even if I’m not 100% sure.”
Effects:
✔ True positives go UP (catch more real fraud)
✘ False positives also go UP (more innocent users flagged)

👉 “If we care about maximizing true positives, we lower the cut-off.”
Meaning:
“Lower the threshold so we classify more users as fraud.”
Effects:
Catch more real frauds (TP goes up)
But make more false accusations (FP goes up)
This is OK when:
Missing a fraud is more dangerous than bothering an innocent user
(e.g., credit card fraud)

👉 “Maximize TPR – FPR to choose the best cut-off.”
This is actually Youden’s J statistic, a standard method.
It means:
Choose the point on the ROC curve that is furthest away from the diagonal random line.
In plain English:
“Pick the threshold where your model is doing its best job of catching fraud
( high TPR )
WITHOUT wrongly accusing too many users
( low FPR ).”
This is usually the most balanced choice.

🎯 So how do you actually choose the “right” threshold?
There are three mainstream approaches, depending on business needs.

1️⃣ If false positives are very expensive
(e.g., blocking legit customers), choose a point on the ROC curve with:
Very low FPR
Even if TPR is moderate
This gives a high threshold (strict model).

2️⃣ If missing fraud is very expensive
(e.g., stolen credit cards)
Choose a point with:
Very high TPR
Even if FPR rises
This gives a low threshold (sensitive model).

3️⃣ Balanced approach (most common)
Use:
✔ Youden’s J = TPR – FPR
Pick the threshold where J is highest.
This is auto-calculated in tools like:
sklearn
R
SAS
This typically gives a threshold around 0.3–0.5, depending on the model.

🧠 The simplest explanation possible
✔ Raising threshold
= fewer false alarms but more missed frauds

✔ Lowering threshold
= more fraud caught but more innocent users flagged

✔ Youden’s J (TPR – FPR)
= best balance between catching fraud and avoiding false alarms

⭐ Final cheat-sheet
| Business Goal         | What to do          | Model Behavior    |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| Avoid false positives | Raise the threshold | FPR ↓, TPR ↓      |
| Catch all fraud       | Lower the threshold | TPR ↑, FPR ↑      |
| Balanced model        | Maximize TPR–FPR    | Optimal threshold |

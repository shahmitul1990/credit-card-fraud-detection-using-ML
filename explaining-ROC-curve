Here is a simple, clean, intuitive explanation of those statements — no math, no jargon, just the logic behind ROC curves, false positives, and choosing the right cut-off.

# ✅ First: What does the ROC curve actually show?

The ROC curve is a tool that helps you decide where to set the probability cut-off for predicting fraud.

Your model outputs a probability like:

User A → 0.92 → likely fraud

User B → 0.10 → probably safe

User C → 0.48 → unclear

You must choose a threshold (also called cut-off):

If probability ≥ threshold → classify as FRAUD

If probability < threshold → classify as NOT FRAUD

The ROC curve tells you what happens when you move that threshold up or down
